# Preparing your data and code for computationally reproducible publication: A hands-on, BYOCode workshop

This is a step-by-step, practical workshop to prepare research R code and data for computationally reproducible publication. These lessons can be taught in 3 hours if the instructor:student ratio is high. The workshop starts with some brief introductory information about computational reproducibility, but the bulk of the workshop is guided work on participant code and data. The basic best practices for publishing code and data are covered, and participants move through organizing their files, creating a codebook, preparing their code for reuse, creating a README, documentation, and submitting their code and data to share. 

## Prerequisites

* 
* Encapsulate all files within one directory
* Separate code and data into folders named "code" and "data"
* Create GitHub account and upload code to GitHub
* To take advantage of the BYOCode aspect, you should have R code **that runs** + the data it runs on. *Feel free to come if you don't have code - you may follow along with example code and data.*
