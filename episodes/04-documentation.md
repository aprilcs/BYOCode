Create a README file.
It is important to write a brief overview of your project. A README file is a short file (think 1-pager) in the project’s home directory, and typically is the main entry point for readers to the project, including in particular the code. It should thus answer questions others will commonly have when they come upon the project, including the following:
the purpose of the project, such as which problem does it try to solve, and what is its scope
how suitable for reuse is the project, such as stage of maturity it is in
prerequisites and other dependencies, and how to satisfy or obtain them
where and how to start for using it
how to cite and/or terms of reuse
are contributions welcome, and if so, how to best make them
who to contact and how for questions
A README should be written in text, with markup that is easy to read (such as Markdown, Reitz 2016).
Based on the above, items to include in a README file include the following:
the project’s title
a brief description
a purpose statement
up-to-date contact information
a brief tutorial or how-to
any relevant weblinks
