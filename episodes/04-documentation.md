# Create a README file.
A README file is a short overview of your research project. It should answer the common questions that someone might have about your research and the files you have shared.

## A README should be written in text, easy-to-read, and include:
* the projectâ€™s title
* a brief description
* a purpose statement
* up-to-date contact information
* a brief how-to reuse
